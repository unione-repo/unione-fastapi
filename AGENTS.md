UniOne FastAPI — FastAPI integration of the UniOne Python SDK (`unione-sdk`) for the UniOne transactional email Web API (Web API 1.92). How to integrate UniOne into a FastAPI application comes first; the last section is about changing this package.

## Integrating UniOne with this package

FastAPI integration of the [UniOne Python SDK](https://github.com/unione-repo/unione-python-sdk) (`unione-sdk`): the API client in the dependencies (`Depends(get_client)`), a webhook endpoint with signature check. Full guide: [README.md](README.md).

### Install

```bash
pip install unione-fastapi
```

Requirements: Python 3.8+, FastAPI 0.100+.

### Configuration

The API key goes to `UNIONE_API_KEY`.

```bash
UNIONE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
UNIONE_HOST=us1.unione.io
```

`us1.unione.io` in the example is for an account on another datacenter; without the host setting the package uses `api.unione.io`.

| Option | Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Settings.api_key` | `UNIONE_API_KEY` |  | User or project API key (required). |
| `Settings.host` | `UNIONE_HOST` | `api.unione.io` | API host (datacenter: `api.unione.io`, `eu1.unione.io`, `us1.unione.io`) or a full base URL. |
| `Settings.timeout` | `UNIONE_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Request timeout, seconds. |
| `Settings.webhook_key` | `UNIONE_WEBHOOK_KEY` |  | API key the webhooks are signed with (the key of the user/project of the webhook), if it differs from the API key. |
| `Settings.webhook_path` | `UNIONE_WEBHOOK_PATH` | `/unione/webhook` | Path of the webhook endpoint. |

Other settings in code: `app.dependency_overrides[get_settings] = lambda: Settings(api_key=...)`.

### API client

The client calls [email/send](https://docs.unione.io/en/web-api-ref#email-send) with all of its options: templates, substitutions, metadata, tracking. Fields of the request and other examples: [Python SDK docs](https://github.com/unione-repo/unione-python-sdk/blob/HEAD/docs/Email.md#send).

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from unione import UniOneClient
from unione.api.email import EmailSendRequest, MessageObject, MessageObjectRecipientsItem as Recipient
from unione.common import BodyObject
from unione_wrapper import get_client


@app.post("/send")
def send_email(client: UniOneClient = Depends(get_client)):
    response = client.email.send(EmailSendRequest(
        message=MessageObject(
            recipients=[Recipient.from_address("Alex <alex@example.com>")],
            from_email="shop@example.com",
            from_name="Shop",
            subject="Your order",
            body=BodyObject.from_html("<p>Hello, {{to_name}}! Your order has shipped.</p>"),
        ),
    ))
    return {"job_id": response.job_id}
```

### Errors

The API client raises the SDK `ApiError`: `kind` tells what failed (api, network, timeout, invalid_response, invalid_request), `retryable` whether a repeat may succeed (network, timeout, HTTP 429 and 5xx), `hint` how to fix an API error and `api_message` the message of the API.

### Webhooks

The endpoint answers `GET` with 200 OK (the URL check of [webhook/set](https://docs.unione.io/en/web-api-ref#webhook-set)) and accepts the `POST` notifications: it checks the `auth` field (MD5 of the request body in which the `auth` value is replaced by the API key), answers 401 to a wrong signature, and passes the notification and each of its events to the application.

```python
from unione_wrapper import Webhooks

webhooks = Webhooks()


@webhooks.on_event
async def on_event(event, user):
    data = event.event_data
    print(event.event_name, data.email, data.status)


app.include_router(webhooks.router())  # /unione/webhook
```

Register the URL of the endpoint with `webhook/set`, e.g. `https://example.com/unione/webhook`.

> **Answer 200 within 3 seconds** and process the events in the background (a queue): otherwise UniOne repeats the request every 10 minutes for 24 hours (`retry_count` grows), and a handler that failed every request for at least 10 events of a day is turned inactive. The handler must take at least **5 parallel requests of up to 100 events each**; deduplicate, a repeat delivers the same events again.

### Rules for generated code

- Server-side only. Read the API key from `UNIONE_API_KEY`; never put it in browser or mobile code, never commit it.
- Base URL `https://api.unione.io/en/transactional/api/v1` (an account registered on another host uses that one: `eu1.unione.io`, `us1.unione.io`); every method is POST with a JSON body; auth header `X-API-KEY`. The package does all of it.
- First email without DNS: `domain/get-sandbox-domain` → `confirmed-email/create` (the user clicks the link within 48 hours) → `email/send` from `noreply@<sandbox-domain>` to the confirmed address. Account API key only; up to 10 confirmed addresses, 100 emails a day. The domain is deleted 31 days after it was created: the next `domain/get-sandbox-domain` call creates a new one with another name, so read the name from the response, never hardcode it.
- Never ship a sandbox domain as the production sender (it is not in `domain/list`); read `from_email` from config. Production needs a verified domain: `domain/get-dns-records` → DNS records (verification TXT as is, DKIM TXT `v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=<dkim>` on `<selector>._domainkey`, CNAME `_dmarc` → the `dmarc` field; SPF `include:spf.unione.io` is not in the response) → `domain/validate-verification-record`, `domain/validate-dkim` → `domain/list`.
- Set `message.idempotence_key` on every send that may be retried. Retry only an error that is retryable (the retryable flag of the SDK error: network, timeout, `429`, `5xx`; never a request you cancelled), with backoff and the same `idempotence_key`, within the one-minute idempotence window; beyond it check your own "sent" record before sending again. Do not retry other errors unchanged. Up to 500 recipients and 10 MB per request with the attachments in base64 (a third larger than the files); always `body.html` or `body.plaintext` (or a `template_id`).
- Delivery events via webhook (`webhook/set`), not polling; the webhook endpoint of this package checks the `auth` signature (401 when wrong). Keep the listeners fast: answer 200 within 3 seconds and process the events from a queue, otherwise the request is repeated every 10 minutes for 24 hours; take at least 5 parallel requests of up to 100 events each; deduplicate.
- Keep the default unsubscribe and tracking behaviour; changes go through UniOne support.
- Do not invent methods or fields. Check the [README](README.md), the [API reference](https://docs.unione.io/en/web-api-ref) or [llms.txt](https://docs.unione.io/llms.txt).

## Working on this repository

- **Generated code.** The whole package is generated by the UniOne team from the UniOne Web API OpenAPI spec (Web API 1.92): sources, docs, README.md and this file. Do not hand-edit it: the next release replaces the content of this repository. Report problems and requests in the issues of this repository (https://github.com/unione-repo/unione-fastapi).
- **Build and check:**

  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e .
  ```

- **Source label.** Every request carries the query parameter `platform=fastapi.1.3.2,python-sdk.1.3.1` (this package, then the SDK it is built on).
- **Tests.** `python -m pip install -e ".[test]" && python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` runs the tests of the package (with the test tools of FastAPI, not published) offline: the API is faked, never the real API, no real key; they install the SDK version the package requires from the registry. Before a release the generator also installs the package into a test app of FastAPI and checks the client, the webhook endpoint against a mock of the API. The CI (.github/workflows/test.yml) runs the tests on every push and pull request over the supported runtimes; release.yml publishes a tag only after they pass.
- **Release.** The version (1.3.2 in pyproject.toml) and the tag `v1.3.2` come from the generator; README.md states the Web API version the release was generated from.
- **Secrets.** Never commit API keys; the examples read `UNIONE_API_KEY` from the environment.
